# AMLynx

**AMLynx** is a modular, production-ready **Anti-Money Laundering (AML)** scoring service. It combines a **data-driven rules engine** with **unsupervised anomaly detection** to produce an interpretable, real-time **risk score** and optional alerts for incoming transactions.

The project is designed for:

* **Clarity & extensibility** (typed Python, modular package layout, rule registry)
* **Operational readiness** (FastAPI, JSON logging, Postgres, CI hooks)
* **Reproducibility** (config in env, persisted ML models, seed & train scripts)
